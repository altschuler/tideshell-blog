## Point-and-click with a twist

* Learn strange new languages to communicate with the people you meet on your way by collecting drawings in a notebook, showing them to locals to get the word in their language and then using it in a sentence.
* Use the ancient Tideshell to manipulate the levels of water to make your way through a sunken city and catch fish in a dried out lake.
